# Student-Rank-Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the NEET rank of a student based on their quiz performance using historical data from past quizzes and performance insights. The goal is to analyze the data, uncover patterns, and generate insights on a student's strengths and weaknesses, and then build a model to predict their NEET rank.

Additionally, bonus points are awarded for predicting the most likely college a student might get admitted to based on their rank.

Project Structure
Data Analysis: Analyze student performance across different topics, difficulty levels, and accuracy of responses.
Rank Prediction: Build an algorithm or probabilistic model to predict the student's NEET rank.
College Prediction: Extend the solution to suggest possible colleges based on predicted rank.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Flask, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data: The datasets provided (Current Quiz Data, Historical Quiz Data) via API endpoints.
